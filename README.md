## Tropical Storm Difficulty Mod
- Adds a new difficulty, Tropical Storm. 
- This difficulty starts off hard with an initial all stats increase of 50% and decrease all stats by 50% for each loop.
- (Those are the default values, you can edit them in the config, you can modify it to start with lower stats or gain stats per loop instead for example)
